# SENTINEL Workforce Systems™ - Demonstration Interface

## Overview

This is a **static, procurement-safe demonstration interface** designed for institutional stakeholders including CFOs, General Counsel, Risk Officers, and regulators.

**This is not a functional product.**

---

## What You Have

### 1. Complete Project Structure
See `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` for:
- Folder and file organization
- Section purposes and objectives
- Design principles
- Technical approach (Next.js static export)

### 2. Full Content Copy
See `CONTENT_COPY.md` for:
- Complete placeholder text for all six sections
- Conservative, institutional tone
- Audit-safe language
- Proper disclaimers

---

## Six Core Sections

1. **Governance Overview** - Framework and institutional context
2. **Risk Surfaces** - Representative risk categories (illustrative only)
3. **Sell Sequence** - Expertise → Risk Audit → Governance Core
4. **Governance Artifacts** - Redacted documentation examples
5. **Research & Institutional Alignment** - Grounding in established frameworks
6. **What This Is Not** - Explicit limitations and disclaimers

---

## Next Steps to Build

To implement this as a Next.js static site:

```bash
# Initialize Next.js project
npx create-next-app@latest sentinel-demo --typescript --tailwind --app

# Navigate to project
cd sentinel-demo

# Create folder structure as outlined in PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md

# Implement components and pages using content from CONTENT_COPY.md

# Configure static export in next.config.js:
# module.exports = {
#   output: 'export',
# }

# Build static site
npm run build

# Result: Static HTML/CSS/JS in 'out' folder
```

## Design Constraints Met

- No real data
- No simulated metrics
- No dashboards that update
- No user accounts
- No backend
- No databases
- No analytics
- Static content only
- Serious, institutional tone
- Audit-safe language
- All examples labeled "Illustrative / Representative"
- No invented features
- No simulated outcomes
- Only the six specified sections

---

## Tone Characteristics

- Formal
- Framework-oriented
- Non-promotional
- Conservative
- Descriptive, not prescriptive
- No superlatives
- No claims of efficacy

---

## Visual Approach

- Grayscale or muted blue palette
- Generous whitespace
- Clear typography (system fonts)
- No animations
- No images of people
- No charts or visualizations
- Clean, institutional layout

---

## Files Provided

1. `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` - Complete architectural documentation
2. `CONTENT_COPY.md` - Full placeholder copy for all pages
3. `README.md` - This file

## Important Notes

### What This Interface Does
- Describes governance processes and frameworks
- Provides representative examples of risk categories
- Shows illustrative documentation types
- References established institutional standards

### What This Interface Does NOT Do
- Process data
- Generate metrics
- Provide compliance automation
- Offer legal or audit advice
- Predict or prevent risks
- Function as software

---

## Procurement Safety

This demonstration is designed to be:
- **Non-committal** - Makes no claims about functionality or outcomes
- **Transparent** - Clearly states what it is and is not
- **Audit-safe** - Language appropriate for regulatory review
- **Educational** - Focused on explanation, not operation
- **Static** - No dynamic systems that could be misconstrued as functional

---

## Questions?

This demonstration interface is self-contained and fully documented.
All content is provided in the accompanying markdown files.

For implementation, follow the technical approach outlined in `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` using the content provided in `CONTENT_COPY.md`.
